# Image-classification-using-vision-Transformers
This project demonstrates image classification using Vision Transformers (ViTs), leveraging pre-trained models to achieve high accuracy on various image datasets. Vision Transformers are a cutting-edge approach in computer vision, utilizing transformer architecture to model long-range dependencies in images effectively.

# Features
* Pre-trained Models: Utilizes state-of-the-art Vision Transformers pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet.
* Transfer Learning: Fine-tunes pre-trained models for custom datasets to improve performance.
* Multi-class Classification: Supports classification of multiple categories with high accuracy.
web interface :uploaded on web using flask.

# Technologies Used
* Libraries: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, timm
* Frameworks: Flask/Streamlit for deployment
* Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn for result analysis
